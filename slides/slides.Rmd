# Documentation Types

Daniele Procida talks about the **4** kinds of documentation with **different purposes** and requiring **different approaches**.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "A title slide of a dark grey background with the title 'What nobody tells you about documentation' in light blue text at the bottom of the slide. Just above the title is a horizontal light gray line and above that the presenter's name: 'Daniele Procida'."}

# User Personas

---
# Definition

**Personas** are descriptions of imaginary users, to help guide the design of your project.

--

A **good** persona includes:
* background knowledge and experience
* motivations and needs
* concerns and barriers

---
# Example User Persona

.small[River is a PhD student in biology.

River's previous research experience is in a non-computational wet lab. They have taken the standard math courses for biology majors, including stats.

River wants to digitize their data for statistical analyses and to share for other people to use. River is also curious about using other people's data for meta-analyses.

River is using physical logbooks in their current project. River has previously struggled to use Excel in stats class, and is worried after hearing that spreadsheets will alter their data or introduce errors.

1. Know your users and what they need
2. Get  users doing powerful things quickly
3. Watch out for jargon!

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "A clip from Schitt's Creek. A white male in his 30s in a white sweater with black stripes and a blue apron with pink flowers is stirring a pot in the kitchen. His mother, a white female in her 60s in a black dress and glasses is holding a small piece of paper, intended to be a recipe of some kind. The man has a skeptical look and is asking 'What does \"Fold in the cheese\" mean?'. The dialogue also appears in the clip as a caption."}
