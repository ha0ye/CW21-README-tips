Daniele Procida talks about the **4** kinds of documentation with **different purposes** and requiring **different approaches**.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "A title slide of a dark grey background with the title 'What nobody tells you about documentation' in light blue text at the bottom of the slide. Just above the title is a horizontal light gray line and above that the presenter's name: 'Daniele Procida'."}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "A clip from Schitt's Creek. A white male in his 30s in a white sweater with black stripes and a blue apron with pink flowers is stirring a pot in the kitchen. His mother, a white female in her 60s in a black dress and glasses is holding a small piece of paper, intended to be a recipe of some kind. The man has a skeptical look and is asking 'What does \"Fold in the cheese\" mean?'. The dialogue also appears in the clip as a caption."}
