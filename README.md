## Description

READMEs are one of the primary ways that new users first encounter your
project; and hopefully not the last! This mini-workshop will review
practices in creating READMEs so as to best welcome people to your
project, communicate the vision of your work and its unique value, and
demonstrate how to get started using or contributing to your project.
Participants will engage in short group discussions about READMEs and
user personas, and then engage in scaffolded practice on crafting
READMEs for their own personal projects or provided examples.

## Prerequisites

This lesson assumes you:

-   have experience with GitHub projects
-   are familiar with writing in markdown

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

-   know the different types of technical documentation
-   create personas to aid product design
-   structure simple READMEs
